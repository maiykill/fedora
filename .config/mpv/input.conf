## Seek units are in seconds, but note that these are limited by keyframes
#RIGHT seek  5                          # seek 5 seconds forward
#LEFT  seek -5                          # seek 5 seconds backward
#UP    seek  60                         # seek 1 minute forward
#DOWN  seek -60                         # seek 1 minute backward
# Do smaller, always exact (non-keyframe-limited), seeks with shift.
# Don't show them on the OSD (no-osd).
#Shift+RIGHT no-osd seek  1 exact       # seek exactly 1 second forward
#Shift+LEFT  no-osd seek -1 exact       # seek exactly 1 second backward
#Shift+UP    no-osd seek  5 exact       # seek exactly 5 seconds forward
#Shift+DOWN  no-osd seek -5 exact       # seek exactly 5 seconds backward
#Ctrl+LEFT   no-osd sub-seek -1         # seek to the previous subtitle
#Ctrl+RIGHT  no-osd sub-seek  1         # seek to the next subtitle
